# cheap-CUDA-experiment
This repo shows how I discover GPU parallelism with CUDA.
It is formed in a kind of tutorial, where I move from a pure python code to the
precumpiled GPU program comparing performances of various implementations.
All the content is essentially gathered in a single Jupyter Notebook main.ipynb.
I also leave a folder with my early sketches, but without much description.
